I'm using PHP (which I'm running straight on the command line) for now, but I might mix it up if a challenge pops up that Personal HomePage can't handle (yeah, right).

I'm also implementing the quickest, dirtiest solution I can think of to solve the problem. No considerations to code quality, performance, professionalism etc.

I probably won't be solving the problems every day either. Just as and when.
