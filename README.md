# adventofcode-solutions
For sharing all the nasty hacky solutions to http://adventofcode.com/

## Rules

Commit to your folder. No-one elses. Probably fetch and pull before you commit too, in case someone else has been busy.

All code is as hacky as you like. Mine (DaveWishesHe) will be mostly awful.

Don't look at other people's solutions until you've done the puzzle yourself! That's cheating.
